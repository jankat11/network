# network
A reddit like social network web application i created with **Django&amp;Javascript.** 

I designed the site as a single-page application. It was a project I created during the time when I was learning to develop new UI using JavaScript. As a result, there's a massive 1320-line code in a single JS file :) However, thanks to preparing this colossal file on my own, I gained a much better understanding of how JavaScript works, and I became more capable of identifying challenging bugs within complex algorithms. After learning React.js later on, everything became much easier. While it might not align perfectly with clean code principles and might not be well-organized, I will always want to keep this project as a memory.
